#I will put the Jupyter notebook and .py file in this repository.

1.The first thing you need to do is create an empty folder, for example, "C:\Users\gis\Desktop\CVD_Deaths_Project".
2.Get the SST data you have downloaded from NASA, for example, from here: "https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/l3/order/".
3.Extract it into the empty folder so that the .nc files are in a folder named "requested_files", for example, "C:\Users\gis\Desktop\CVD_Deaths_Project\requested_files".
4.Check the files and choose which .nc files you want to include in your analysis.
5.Create a new Map project in ArcGIS Pro in the "CVD_Deaths_Project" folder you created earlier. Give the project the same name as the folder and uncheck the "create new folder for this project" box.
6.Copy and paste the "CreateSSTPolygonsFromNasaSSTRasters.ipynb" Jupyter notebook into the folder where the ArcGIS Pro project is located. Double-click to run it.
7.Change the location of the "input_folder" to the location of your folder you created in the first part of the code:

import arcpy
import os

# Input folder
input_folder = r"C:\Users\gis\Desktop\CVD_Deaths_Project\requested_files"  # replace this with your location


8.The code is divided into 5 segments, run them one by one. Be patient in the Jupyter notebook. In the top right, there is "ArcGISPro" writing and a circle. When the code is running, the circle will be colored. Wait until it is hollowed out like this O.
9.After running the last segment, search for the result in the "sst_polygons.gdb" in the project folder created earlier.
10.Enjoy your SST vector polygons with mean temperatures represented into zones made from NASA raster data.
